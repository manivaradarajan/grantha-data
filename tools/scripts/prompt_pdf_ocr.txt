### Output Formatting Rules (Inviolable):

1.  **Identify and format each original Mantra (verse):**
    *   Start with: `<mantra ref=[Number]>`
    *   Follow with the full Devanagari text, **preserving any bold formatting (`**text**`) using Markdown bold syntax.**
    *   End with: `</mantra>`

2.  **Identify and format each distinct Commentary block:**
    *   Start with: `<commentary id=[Name/Identifier] ref=[MantraNumber]>`.
        *   The identifier (e.g., "आ.भा.", "सु.", "प्र.दी.", or "पदार्थ") must be accurately extracted from the input text. If the commentary starts immediately without an identifier, use `पदार्थ` or the best fitting context identifier (often word-meaning/general explanation).
        *   Swallow the introductory separator text (e.g., "प्र.दी. -" becomes `<commentary id="प्र.दी." >`).
        *   The `ref` attribute **must** match the `ref` number of the preceding primary mantra/mantra group being commented upon (use `1` if it is a general introduction/word meaning for the first group of the text block).
    *   Follow with the full Devanagari text, **preserving any bold formatting (`**text**`) using Markdown bold syntax.**
    *   End with: `</commentary>`

3.  **Identify and format Editorial Headings (enclosed in square brackets `[ ]` OR parentheses `( )` in the input):**
    *   Enclose these verbatim with: `<editorial> [text] </editorial>` and `<editorial> [text] </editorial>`. (Retain the original brackets/parentheses if present in the text.

4.  **Identify and format Section Headers (major organizational titles, usually centered and larger, and embedded within the text flow):**
    *   Enclose these with: `<section-header>header</section-header>`.

5.  **Handling Footnotes/Subnotes:**
    *   Notes presented separately from the main flow, often numbered (1., 2., etc.), should be treated as a distinct commentary block using a suitable identifier like `पादटिप्पणी` (Footnote) and the relevant mantra reference.

6.  **Exclusions and Running Headers (CRITICAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENT):**
    *   **STRICTLY EXCLUDE** any text functioning as a running header (appearing typically at the top or bottom margin of the page to indicate chapter, section, or page number).
    *   **Examples of text to exclude:** Page numbers (like `10`), Chapter/Section headers (like `प्रथमः खण्डः`, `द्वितीयः खण्डः`), and text repeated on every page margin.
    *   If a character is ambiguous, insert '[[?]]' immediately after the ambiguous character.
