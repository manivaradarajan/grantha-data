You are an expert system specializing in LLM performance optimization and Sanskrit text analysis. Your task is to perform a complete analysis of the provided markdown document and produce a single, unified JSON response containing four sections: `metadata`, `structural_analysis`, `chunking_strategy`, and `parsing_instructions`.

Your entire response must be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any explanatory text or markdown formatting (like ```json) before or after the JSON object.

---

### **1. Metadata Section (`metadata`):**
Extract the metadata as described below.
*   `canonical_title`: Full Sanskrit name.
*   `grantha_id`: Standardized ID.
*   `commentary_id`: Commentary ID or `null`.
*   `commentator`: Commentator name or `null`.

---

### **2. Structural Analysis Section (`structural_analysis`):**
Analyze and define the hierarchical structure of the document **and establish the starting coordinate.**

*   **Goal:** Identify all levels of division from the largest to the smallest (e.g., Prapathaka -> Khanda -> Mantra).
*   **Output Structure:** Represent this hierarchy as a nested JSON object under the `structure_levels` key. For each level, provide a `key` (PascalCase), and `scriptNames` for both Devanagari and roman scripts.
*   **Numbering Context (CRITICAL):**
    1.  **Identify Headers:** Look for the specific headers in the document corresponding to your identified structure levels (e.g., "Prathama Adhyaya", "Panchami Valli", "Dvitiya Patala").
    2.  **Translate Numerals:** Convert the Sanskrit ordinals or cardinals found in those headers into integers (e.g., *Prathama* -> 1, *Panchami* -> 5, *Ekadasha* -> 11).
    3.  **Determine Start ID:** Create a `starting_id` string in dot-notation (e.g., "5.1" or "2.3.1") that represents the full coordinate of the **first** unit (Mantra/Sutra/Verse) found in this text.
    4.  **Logic:**
        *   If the header is "Fifth Valli" and the first verse is "1", `starting_id` = "5.1".
        *   If the header is "Chapter 2", Sub-section "Section 3", and the first verse is "1", `starting_id` = "2.3.1".
        *   If no parent headers exist, `starting_id` = "1".

---

### **3. Chunking Strategy Section (`chunking_strategy`):**
Devise an optimal, deterministic chunking strategy following a strict validation protocol.

**Protocol:**
1.  **Goal:** Maximize chunk size to minimize API calls.
2.  **Hard Rule:** Never split a primary section (e.g., `खण्डः`) internally.
3.  **Chunking Rule:** Each major structural unit (e.g., `खण्डः`, `वल्ली`, `प्रपाठकः`) should be in its own chunk, unless combining them is necessary to meet a minimum chunk size. For this project, there is no minimum chunk size, so create a new chunk for each major structural unit.
4.  **Calculation and Validation (CRITICAL):**
    *   For each chunk you propose in the `execution_plan`, you **MUST** calculate its character length and report it in the `estimated_character_count` field.
    *   This `estimated_character_count` **MUST NOT** exceed the `safety_character_limit` of **125,000**.
    *   **Self-Correction:** Before finalizing your response, you must verify this condition for all chunks. If any chunk violates the limit, you must split that chunk into two or more smaller, compliant chunks (breaking only at a valid `खण्डः` boundary) and regenerate the plan until all chunks pass validation.
*   **Output:** Provide a machine-readable `execution_plan` that adheres to this protocol.

---

### **4. Parsing Instructions Section (`parsing_instructions`):**
Provide instructions for parsing the primary structural units (e.g., `खण्डः`) *within* each chunk.
*   `recommended_unit`: Name of the logical unit to parse.
*   `numbering_capture_strategy`: Brief explanation of how to extract the unit number (e.g., "Extract the Devanagari numeral at the end of the bold line").
*   `start_pattern`: Object with description, examples, and regex.
*   `end_pattern`: Object with description, examples, and regex.
*   `pre_content_handling`: Instructions for initial text like `शान्तिपाठः`.
